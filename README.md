# Additional info
This is my first ever mod, and while I'm proud of it, it may be slightly unbalanced <sub>(and unfortunately I mean that in the more underpowered rather than overpowered way...)</sub>, I may make some changes to it in the future but I don't think that's too likely. Yapfest over, have fun!<br><br>
